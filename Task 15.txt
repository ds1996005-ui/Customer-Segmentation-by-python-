# 📖 The Story of RFM Segmentation

## Act I: The Mystery of the Customers  
Once upon a time, a company had thousands of customers. The managers wanted to know:  
- Who are our **Champions**?  
- Who are our **Loyal friends**?  
- Who is **At Risk** of leaving?  

To solve this mystery, they called upon a detective — **you, armed with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib**.

## Act II: Gathering Clues  
The detective opened the company’s file cabinet (`customer_segmentation_data.csv`).  
He cleaned the messy labels (`df.columns.str.strip()`) so every clue had a proper name.  
Then he examined the **Purchase History**, turning it into real dates (`pd.to_datetime`).  
This gave him a timeline of customer activity.

## Act III: Building Profiles  
For each customer, the detective wrote down three traits:  
- **Recency** → How many days since their last purchase.  
- **Frequency** → How many purchases they made.  
- **Monetary** → How much money they spent (`Premium Amount`).  

Now every customer had a **profile card**.

## Act IV: Scoring the Suspects  
The detective gave scores to each trait:  
- Recent visitors got high Recency scores.  
- Frequent buyers got high Frequency scores.  
- Big spenders got high Monetary scores.  

He combined them into a single **RFM Score** — the detective’s rating of customer value.

## Act V: Sorting into Groups  
With the notebook full, the detective labeled customers:  
- 🏆 **Champions** → The best of the best.  
- 💙 **Loyal** → Reliable friends.  
- 🌱 **Potential Loyalists** → New faces with promise.  
- ⚠️ **At Risk** → Old friends drifting away.  
- 💤 **Hibernating** → Customers gone quiet.  

Each customer now wore a badge showing their role in the story.

## Act VI: Presenting the Evidence  
The detective drew a bar chart with matplotlib.  
The managers could now see the balance: how many Champions, how many At Risk, and so on.  
Finally, he exported the full report (`rfm_segments.csv`) — a clear map of customer behavior.

## 🎯 The Moral  
By turning raw purchase data into RFM scores, the detective transformed a messy spreadsheet into a **story of loyalty, risk, and opportunity**.  
Now the company knows who to reward, who to re‑engage, and who to let go.
